## Doubt areas

### Pyramid match kernel (lec6)
* How is partial matching between sets of features robust to occlusion, cluttering and segmentation errors?

* Go into a little bit more detail about Optimal Match between sets and how pyramid match is a good approximation?
  * [Look at the definition of Optimal Match in the paper,go to Page 6,Preliminaries Section](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/vip/papers/grauman_jmlr07.pdf)
  * [Paper on pyramid match kernel by Grauman and Darrell](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/grauman_darrell_iccv05.pdf)

### Local Coordinate Coding
* Principally a mathematical concept. Discuss with Sir.
