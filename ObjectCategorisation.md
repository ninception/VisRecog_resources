### Gamma Correction 
 * An Image Processing step, often taken before recognition tasks, to correct the nonlinear transformation of light intensity to pixel values. Look at [Wiki Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction).

## Doubt areas

### Pyramid match kernel (lec6)
* How is partial matching between sets of features robust to occlusion, cluttering and segmentation errors?

* Go into a little bit more detail about Optimal Match between sets and how pyramid match is a good approximation?
  * [Look at the definition of Optimal Match in the paper,go to Page 6,Preliminaries Section](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/vip/papers/grauman_jmlr07.pdf)
 

### Local Coordinate Coding
* Principally a mathematical concept. Discuss with Sir.
